Tasty is an app that is built on Flask in Python 2.7.  This version is being switched over to use firebase instead
of postgreSQL.  Firebase is awesome!

Tasty allows a user to search for a flavor and receive a list of flavor matches that are good matches.  

This is a tool for building flavor profiles.  Good for cooks and anybody who wants to wing it in the kitchen but not 
totally bomb.
